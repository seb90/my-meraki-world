# My-Cisco-Meraki-API-World
Everything here is about the Cisco Meraki API.
Below you will find my documentation on various topics related to Meraki API usage.
I'll show you the tools and libraries I use... so have fun making your own.


### My test environment
I use two different development and test environments. On the one hand I develop on a MacBook (with PyCharm), on the other hand I have a small Fujitsu server with Proxmox, on which I run Debian containers. But a Raspberry Pi will also do.

### Programs & libraries that I use
1. Redis
2. influxdb
3. Grafana
4.
